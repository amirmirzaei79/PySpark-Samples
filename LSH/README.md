## LSH Algorithm

LSH algorithm and exhaustive search for finding near neighbors to an image patch.

Data is from [Standford CS 246](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs246/index.html), Homework 1.

Each row in this dataset is a 20 Ã— 20 image patch represented as a 400-dimensional vector. L1 distance is used for comparison.

Data is zipped to reduce size, to run this code, first unzip the data.
